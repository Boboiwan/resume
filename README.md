### ðŸ”¹ Reflection

In designing my personal resume website, I chose a clean and modern layout with a fixed left sidebar to mimic the feel of a professional blog. This design allows users to easily navigate through sections without scrolling too far. I used calm, dark tones for the navigation and light backgrounds for content to ensure readability and contrast.

One of the main challenges I faced was aligning the navigation bar so it wouldnâ€™t overlap the content. I resolved this by adjusting the content margin and testing the layout across different screen sizes. Implementing dynamic content using W3school of multiple HTML files was also a new experience.

Through this project, I learned how to structure a responsive layout, enhance user interaction with smooth transitions, and apply W3school to load content dynamically. Overall, the experience improved my understanding of web design principles and front-end development.
